 mod_mysql_vhost SQL injection and path traversal
==================================================

CVE-2014-2323 [1] was assigned to SQL injection bug.
CVE-2014-2324 [2] was assigned to the path traversal bug.

The fix for CVE-2014-2323 also fixes CVE-2014-2324.

 Description
-------------

Jann Horn <jann@thejh.net> reported a MySQL injection vulnerability through 
a combination of two bugs:

* request_check_hostname is too lax: it allows any host names starting with
  [ipv6-address] followed by anything but a colon, for example:

  GET /etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
  Host: [::1]' UNION SELECT '/

* mod_mysql_vhost doesn't perform any quoting; it just replaces ? in the 
  query string with the hostname.


mod_evhost and mod_simple_vhost are vulnerable in a limited way too; a 
pattern: evhost.path-pattern = "/var/www/%0/" with a host "[]/../../../" 
leads to document root of "/var/www/[]/../../../", but as "/var/www/[]" 
usually doesn't exists this fails (this might depend on the operating 
system in use).
If there exist directories like "/var/www/[...]" for IPv6 addresses as 
host names (or a user can create them) mod_evhost and mod_simple_vhost 
are vulnerable too.

mod_status, mod_webdav and a global redirect handler use the host name 
without escaping too; in these cases the client just gets the broken data 
back - the attacker doesn't gain anything here.

 Detailed analysis
-------------------

Quoting the report from Jann Horn:
> Have a look at this special case of request_check_hostname in request.c:
(See [3])
> So, when the hostname starts with a '[', only this block of code validates the 
> user-supplied hostname. First, the code incorrectly commented with 
> "/* check portnumber */" checks that until ']', only something resembling an 
> IPv6 address can appear. Then it is checked that the hostname is correctly 
> terminated with a ']'. But then, it only validates that a correct port number 
> follows if the next char is a ':'. If the next char is anything else, the rest 
> of the Host header is not subjected to any kind of check before being stored 
> into con->uri.authority.

> In a lighttpd without anything special, this already means that an attacker can 
> sneak spaces into the logfile, potentially confusing logfile parsers. However, 
> it gets really interesting when the server uses mod_mysql_vhost (not 
> mod_simple_vhost or mod_evhost): con->uri.authority is inserted into an SQL 
> query without any escaping, allowing the attacker to control what the database 
> responds with - and the response of the database is then taken as document 
> root. Therefore, an attacker can change the document root to / for his request 
> and thereby effectively perform directory traversal.

If one wants to search for uses of con->uri.authority one should also search 
for con->server_name.

 Affected versions
-------------------

All versions up to and including 1.4.34.

 Patch
-------

See [4] (simple patch) or [5] (svn commit including test cases).

 Fixed in
----------

1.4.x: http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/repository/revisions/2959
1.4.35: http://www.lighttpd.net/2014/3/12/1.4.35/

 Solutions or workaround
-------------------------

* Disable mod_mysql_vhost.
* Don't use mod_evhost or mod_simple_vhost for IPv6 addresses as host names
  (i.e. don't have and don't allow creation of "[...]" directories in the
  base directories)
